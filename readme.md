# Budget & Income tracker
## Wilson Guasca project

The plan is to create a web application that allows users to easily manage their personal budgets and track income. The application will provide features to help users control their finances with easy, simple interface. Additionally, it will generate useful reports to visualize financial data.


## Features

1.  **User Registration and Authentication:**    
    -   Users can create accounts and log in securely.

2.  **Dashboard:**
    -   An overview of income, expenses, and current financial status.
    -   Grouped by month and YTD.

3.  **Income Tracking:**
    -   Users can add and categorize different sources of income (e.g., salary, bank interest, rental income).
 
4.  **Expense Tracking:**
    -   Users can add and categorize expenses (e.g., rent, groceries, utilities).

5.  **Transaction History:**
    -   A detailed log of all income and expense transactions.

6.  **Useful Reports:**
    -   Income vs. Expense Report: A visual representation of monthly income and expenses to compare and analyze.

## Development 

**Tech Stack**
- NetCore 6
- DAL-BizLogic separation
- Dapper
- FluentMigrator.Runner (for migrations)
- React/Vue frontend
TDD as the development approach cannot be fully applied since it could require long time previous to actual dev starting, plus the validation of coverage cannot be assess at this time.
